Let R and B be the red and black sock count in the bag.
We are told that the probability to get 2 red socks successively is 0.5.
This can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{R}{R+B} \times \frac{R-1}{R-1+B} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Developping the above expression, we get:
\[
B^2 + 2 \times R \times B - B - R^2 + R = 0
\]

Possible solutions for this equation are computede by the main.cc program.
For instance, having B = 6 results in the following equation:

\[ - R^2 + 13 \times R + 30 = 0 \]

which has R = 15 as a valid solution.
